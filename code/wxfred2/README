"/wxfred2/base" contains the tool generated files which are derived by all windows, frames, and dialogs found elsewhere in "/wxfred2"

"/wxfred2/editors" contains the source code for frames and dialogs listed under the Editors menu in wxFRED2.

"/wxfred2/help" contains the source code for the "About" and help dialogs listed under the Help menu in wxFRED2.

"/wxfred2/misc" contains the source code for miscillanious tools listed under the Misc menu in wxFRED2.

"/wxfred2/res" contains the resouce files used by wxFRED2 during runtime, these are typically images used for the graphic buttons.

Also included in "/wxfred2/base" is an XML resource file (".xrc") which may be, and is recommended to be, used by a WYSIWYG editor to edit the GUI elements of wxfred2. At the time of this writing, wxFormBuilder v3.3 - beta proved to be stable enough to create all the elements, although the generated wxFRED2_base.cpp had to be sanitized of deprecated flags in order for it to be compiled under the wxWidgets 2.9.4 lib.


To import wxFRED2.xrc into wxFormBuilder:

1.Open wxFormBuilder, and create a new project (File->New Project)

2.Import wxFRED2.xrc (File->Import XRC...)

3.In the left-hand panel labeled "Object Tree," select the project name at the very top of the tree. You most likely will need to scroll up.

4.In the right-hand panel labeled "Object Properties," change the properties to the following:
  .Under "Project":
  .name to "wxFRED2" or your name of choice
  .path to "/"
  .embedded_files_path to "res/"
  .code_generation to C++, XRC (check both boxes by expanding the group)

5.Under "C++ Properties":
  .use_enum to "checked"
  .namespace to "fredBase"
  .event_generation to "table"
  .disconnect_events to "not checked"

Importing into other WYSIWYG editors should be similar. Be sure the options in steps 4 and 5 are set as they are in order for your newly generated files to play nice with the existing "/wxfred2/" code.

Please be sure to NOT include the project file from the WYSIWYG editor in your commits to the fs2_open repo, as they are far larger than the .xrc and are usually specific to that editor!
