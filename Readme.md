Building
--
Before you do anything, make sure you have updated your git submodules, either by running `git submodule update --init --recursive` or by cloning the repository with the `--recursive` flag.<br/>

The main instructions for building can be found at our github wiki, on the [Building](https://github.com/scp-fs2open/fs2open.github.com/wiki/Building) page.
