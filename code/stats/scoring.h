/*
	The ins and outs of when/where stats are stored and retreived - BE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES

   SINGLE PLAYER :
		scoring_level_init() is called from game_level_init(). This zeroes out mission specific stats
		scoring_level_close() is called from the debriefing screen when the player hits accept. This saves the mission
			stats to alltime stats, and updates any campaign stats
		NOTE : in single player mode, if the player is going back to replay an old mission, the stats shouldn't be 
			stored again

   MULTI PLAYER :
		scoring_level_init() is called in game_level_init() again.
		init_multiplayer_stats() is called on all computers in the game when moving _into_ the MISSION_SYNC state

		scoring_level_close() is called on all machines when the host selects accept. If the host is not on the standalone
			he sends a packet to all players indicating that they should save their data. If he _is_ on the standalone, he should 
			send only to the standalone, and then it rebroadcasts the packet ot everyone else.
